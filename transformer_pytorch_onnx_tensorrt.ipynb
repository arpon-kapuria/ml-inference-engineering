        "\n",
        "- TensorRT engines enforce strict type and shape matching. Unlike flexible frameworks like PyTorch, TensorRT requires exact alignment: the batch size must fall within the defined min/max range, sequence lengths must match the configured dynamic axes, and data types (int32, float32, etc.) must be identical to what was specified during ONNX export. Any mismatch will cause the engine to fail at runtime.\n",

        "- Always validate your inference inputs against both the ONNX model and the built engine. Before running TensorRT inference, verify that your tokenized inputs have the correct shape ranges and data types by inspecting both the original ONNX model specification and the TensorRT engine's tensor metadata. This cross-check prevents hard-to-debug runtime errors and ensures your optimized pipeline works correctly."
